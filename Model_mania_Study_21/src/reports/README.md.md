$$\mathbf{PURPOSE\ AND\ SCOPE}$$

This study was conducted as an early learning exercise to understand as
well as learn the complete workflow of CAD modelling and basic finite
element analysis using **[SolidWorks Simulation.]{.underline}**

The primary focus of this work is not to derive a result, but to gain
hands-on experience with:

- Learning to model in SolidWorks

- Understanding Stress, Displacement, and the Factor of Safety Result.

- Interpreting simulation output.

- Post Processing

- And also writing this report.

This is a simplified static analysis done mainly for learning purposes.
A few assumptions were made to simplify the setup. The results should be
seen as an understanding exercise, not a final or industry-ready
analysis.

**[CAD MODEL OVERVIEW]{.underline}**

The CAD model used in this study was created by me based on a part from
**SolidWorks Model Mania 2021**. The model was recreated using the
provided CAD drawing, following the given dimensions and geometric
features.

> incorrect.](media/image3.jpeg){width="2.9598622047244096in"
> height="2.277775590551181in"}

The purpose of modelling this part was to practice accurate CAD creation
from a technical drawing and then use the same model to explore basic
structural simulation in SolidWorks Simulation. The geometry includes
features such as extrusions, cuts, fillets, and mounting holes, which
make it suitable for observing stress concentration and deformation
behaviour.

The model was not modified or optimised for real-world use and was kept
as per the reference drawing to focus on learning both CAD
interpretation and simulation setup.

**[Some Terms and Prerequisites]{.underline}**

For a static study of a model, we need to define some Fixtures (Fixed
Points: points that might be pinned to a support or nailed down, etc.,
aka the points that won't move under load) and Load Points(Points where
the said load will be applied)

These can be singular or multiple points. In this case, we have used 4
Fixtures(4 Screw posts), and the centre will experience the load.

**[Mesh Information]{.underline}**

First of all, we should understand what Mesh actually is.

In a FEA(Finite Element Analysis), a mesh is the process of dividing a
geometry into a large number of smaller, discrete elements. These
elements are connected at points called nodes. The equations of the
"Physical Problem" are solved at these nodes. Allowing the software(in
this case, SolidWorks Simulations) to \~ approximate how the model will
behave under the load.

So, in our case.

A solid tetrahedral mesh was used for the analysis and generated using
the default meshing settings in SolidWorks. The mesh contained around
9,600 elements and 17,900 nodes. Most of the elements had a good shape,
with more than 97% having a low aspect ratio and no visibly distorted
elements. The mesh was kept reasonably fine so that the results would be
accurate enough while still keeping the simulation time low. Since the
main aim of this study was to understand the simulation process and
workflow, a detailed mesh convergence study was not performed, as it was
a learning journey only.

**So, what are all these titles:**

*[Automatic Transition]{.underline}*: Automatic transition is the option
that controls gradual element size change.

*[Include Mesh Auto Loops:]{.underline}* Auto loops if turned on,
refines mesh around holes and edges automatically.

*[Jacobian Points for high quality mesh]{.underline}*: its checks for
element distortion, in this case 16 points is good and professional

*[Element Size]{.underline}*: This is the global average element edge
length. The analogy is, larger element size equals to faster solve and
less accurate result. And For Finer element size equals to Slower Solve
and greater accuracy.

*[Tolerance]{.underline}*: Tolerance controls how accurately the mesh
follows the model.

*[Nodes]{.underline}*: Nodes are the points at which the displacement is
calculated. More nodes will mean more equations which in result means
more accuracy.

*[Element]{.underline}*: An Element is the smallest finite volume over
which the governing equations are solved.

*[Aspect ratio]{.underline}*: aspect ratio is the ratio of how stretched
an element is.

**[Resultant Forces Experienced]{.underline}**

This is the forces that were experienced by either the entire model or
can be computed at a specific part of the model. But in our case, forces
are calculated only for the entire model.

**[Study Result]{.underline}**

This static finite element analysis was carried out to understand how
the component behaves under an applied load and fixed boundary
conditions. The study mainly focused on observing the stress
distribution and deformation of the model rather than obtaining highly
optimised or final design values. From the results, the regions
experiencing higher stress were clearly visible near the constrained and
load-applied areas, which is expected in a static analysis.

**[Some Plots Along Specific Edges]{.underline}**

This is the Displacement of the top edge of the ring of the model. As we
can see, there is an increase, then a dip, and then another Decrease in
the trend, which can also be visualised in the displacement model.

**[Conclusion]{.underline}**

This static FEA study was a valuable and enjoyable learning experience
that helped build a practical understanding of how finite element
analysis works beyond theory. Creating the model, applying boundary
conditions, generating the mesh, and interpreting the results made the
entire process feel much more intuitive and engaging. Observing how
stresses and deformations develop under static loading was particularly
enlightening, as it connected classroom concepts with real simulation
results. Overall, this study was not only technically informative but
also genuinely fun, and it reinforced interest in further exploring FEA
and simulation-based engineering in future projects.
