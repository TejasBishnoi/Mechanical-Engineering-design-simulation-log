# Mechanical-Engineering-design-simulation-log
This is a personal repo for logging my learning journey in CAD and simulations (CFD &amp; FEA etc). 

Each folder contains:
- The CAD model
- Simulation results (stress, strain, displacement, lift, drag etc)
- Notes on assumptions, boundary conditions, and learnings

This repo is intended as a personal learning log and technical portfolio.
